# AWS-SEVERLESS-DEPLOYMENT
A serverless application to manage student details, built with AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. 
This project follows a fully serverless architecture, enabling cost-efficient, scalable, and easily deployable backend services.
How It Works:
1)API Gateway receives a POST request.
2)Lambda Function (insertStudentData.py) is triggered.
3)DynamoDB Table (StudentData) stores the student details.
